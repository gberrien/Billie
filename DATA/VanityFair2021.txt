18th 2018. october 18th 2019 october 18

million
it's way too many followers girl
but thanks for following me picture of
me and charlie xcx it's a picture of me
smiling when i
first posted a picture of my blonde hair
23 million 54 701
which is
ridiculous
public what is that
well
i
have not been in
at all um since
march
11th
before covet at all like i don't go in
public anyway just because it's a
complete disaster
gosh that girl
was going through an identity crisis oh
my gosh
you can see it in my eyes i mean really
the low bun
please what's going on my attitude used
to be well i can't go out you know i
can't go here i can't go there and i
used to just like not even be able to
like go to a park or like go
get food or get coffee i just it freaked
me out in the last year i have
been opened up
to it i really feel grateful for that
because being able to feel confident in
stepping outside without
a hat and a hood and glasses and a mask
and a jacket and doing this or whatever
it's so much better and you don't have
to live like that and i i realize that
this year that i don't have to live like
that per week if i
am going to stuff it's like anywhere i
go but
if i'm like being cautious and like not
trying to be
in everybody's faces it's like i can
manage
my way around people without them
noticing which is cool i didn't i didn't
used to be able to do that because my
pride was too huge i was like i only
want to be seen if i look like myself
so i would like never wear anything
normal i would wear like
full on like all of the jewelry that i
owned and my hair is blonde now so it's
not like the only person you've ever
seen with green hair walking by and so
who could it be out of the five people
it's gotten a lot easier but if i go out
i mean it's always gonna happen it's
just that i'm first of all fine with it
and i'm i'm very happy about it and also
i just know how to do it now
judge me please
i don't and then one word no
it's my style
billy eilish parody
is my style
i'm so much more open to stuff now so i
guess i would say like
anything
goes any being one word thing being the
second word and then goes
period i did that vogue cover and it was
a genre that we were doing a shoot for
it was a an old kind of hollywood
lingerie
kind of classic
thing
and it was supposed to be like a
specific aesthetic for a photo shoot and
then it was like billy eilish's new
style and then people kept being like
wow her new style like wow it's so much
better than the old style or like wow i
wish that we could have our old style
back i'm so sad that she's
just changed into this and it was so
weird cause i was like it's not a new
style it's
one thing i wore and then i'm gonna wear
this another day and then i'm gonna do
this and literally the thing that i've
been preaching about since i first
started
is
wear what you want
dress how you want act how you want talk
how you want be how you want
that's all i've ever said it's just
being open to new things and not
you know
letting people
ruin it for you i am
for sure a billion times more confident
confident than both of those years
i feel like i'm probably the most
confident i've ever been in my life
that's true
uh yeah no nothing will ever top that
2019
ego
i was feeling myself that is for sure
it's because i had been so miserable for
so long that i finally wasn't and i just
never shut up about it but i've been
i've been good i've been good i mean i'm
starting to have like an adulthood
which is new for me
and
very exciting and i
have had new experiences and new people
and
lots of love
i don't feel
like i do
yes
yeah
uh yep
yeah
but i don't care i really don't
care like it's like
it's the kind of pressure that sounds
like it's me and then i don't care
like i know
and like it's in my brain that people
expect a lot from me and that they
expect this and they want me to do this
and this is just me trying to convince
myself that i didn't care
every single one
every single one i know that i cared and
i was just literally coming up with some
stupid quote that would make me pretend
that i didn't care 80 000 people is way
easier than performing in front of eight
people that's true i used to be just
filled with these like inspirational
quotes just like ready to go all the
time
that i didn't even agree with most of
the time kind of crazy every time i see
an interview from that period when i was
like 16 i'm like
everything i said was so stupid like not
even stupid it just was like not what i
was actually thinking i was thinking
like i'm overwhelmed i hate this
everybody expects something from me i
don't have anything to give them i
 suck
my jewelry is cool
i want tattoos i want a car that's all i
was thinking like i was not thinking
that stuff
i feel a lot of pressure but i also
would say like
back then
i was more loved
i was pretty i was pretty overall like
loved i would say to be honest
and
so i was like scared because i really
wanted to keep that love
and now like tons of people hate me so
i'm not worried anymore i'm like oh okay
well
if you like me like maybe you don't you
don't so
there are things that i regret but i
don't know if i would
change them because everything that
happened that i regret like made me the
way i am and like everybody says that
and it's pretty cliche but it's pretty
true so
i don't know i feel like every situation
that i've been in where
you know maybe i wasn't being the best
that i could i think i learned from it
see
one of those
just another one of those stupid little
oh i'm really smart
and i really know
of course i had regard to regrets dude
don't be so sad it's such a waste of
time
[Music]
don't
post everything you think
this poor kid
oh my god
don't take
anything for granted don't ever come off
stage during this year and think
i didn't really like that show i didn't
really nope
nope
and by the way i'm never doing that
again when shows are allowed i'm
every show is gonna be the best show
i've ever done oh boy you know what's
funny it's so funny how
fast we get used to things it's kind of
scary because you think you know when
you don't have something you think like
oh my god when i have that in front of
me i'm not even gonna get used to it
it's gonna be so exciting and new and
it's exciting for like two seconds and
then it's not and it's super weird i
don't mean shows i just mean everything
in general it takes one second to get
used to stuff
because that's what we're
we're meant to do is adapt i wish that i
could actually tell that year ago billy
because boy was i
suffering not playing shows and not
seeing fans in real life and
you know being able to actually be with
them for real and not through a screen
so it's been amazing but it's so crazy
how fast i just like picked it all right
back up you know i feel like everything
is permanent all the time and it's not
things go in waves and things happen and
things stop and they start and it's like
you you just have no idea what's to come
ever and i think just try to be aware of
the amazing things you have going on
right in the moment instead of
later because even though then you know
i felt like
a year ago now like nothing was good and
and
i had nothing i like to do and there was
nothing that was
and there was so many things that now i
look back and i'm like ah that was cool
and it's just so weird that we don't
realize what's in front of us at all
until it's not it's very weird
my family i'm i'm always talking to my
family always
every second in my life my mom and dad
still come on tour with me finney still
comes on tour with me every day
pretty much every day we're always
together always talking always you know
whatever it's great i love my family i
am so lucky to have my family right now
both of my parents every day for sure i
mean i guess some days go by when i
don't but pretty much every single day
and like phineas pretty much every day
again some days go by right now but
my family is still just as involved as
they have always been in in all the good
ways
i love my family dearly
from fruitvale station
it'll always be up there but i
recently saw a movie called i origins
which was so
so good
i had no idea what it was and i just
finished showed it to me randomly in the
airport and i just it was amazing
five grammys
one two three four
five
six seven
performed at the oscars met like every
celebrity that's ever existed and it was
the most overwhelming insane surreal
thing i've ever experienced i went to
the brits i won a brit it was amazing i
performed
we recorded the bond theme song and
working with hans zimmer and the
orchestra to record it and completely
surreal and amazing
gosh it's been a crazy couple of years
man
i
made an album
i put out an album i did get two more
grammys the documentary came out that
was terrifying went to the bond premiere
in london which was amazing i've never
seen something so crazy i met the royal
family i put out a book i did an amazon
special i put out a movie with disney
which was called a love letter to los
angeles which was amazing
i'm launching a fragrance
which is the most exciting thing to me
no disrespect to all the other things
i've accomplished but
that's very exciting
i was a
host at the met gala
which was
an unbelievable
opportunity
thing i got to do and i wore a big
beautiful dress made by oscar de la
renta
who i
said at the beginning of the
conversation of let's make a miguel
address
you have to stop using fur
because if you don't i'm not working
with you that was also thanks to my mom
for
being with me on that one and and
fighting for it with me so uh
i got oscar de la renta to stop using
fur
completely and that was a really really
big
big thing for me and i i
hope that
more
brands
um follow along with being
environmentally conscious and
try to help the world instead of
make it worse so
yeah
the shows are like the one thing that i
feel like
i've ever been good at i know that
sounds stupid but it's like the only
thing i've ever done that made me feel
like
i belonged
keeping my family safe
and
you know
staying up
cute thing to say
i second that
for sure
i
was really just falling apart not being
able to do shows because
they are the thing that makes me feel
the best that i am
it it feels like the best that i can be
when i'm on stage and getting to do that
again i was like rewound
like i'm a music box that i can be in a
bad mood before a show and then
come off stage and i'm completely
rejuvenated it like winds me up it's
crazy so yeah i agree with that one i've
had some conversations with bieber about
this ariana's been really cool about
stuff even like katy perry told me that
i could reach out to her whenever gaga
has said it to me before it's you know
it's nice to to hear from people that
like have gone through this and know
what it's like
i guess i turned to my mom honestly the
most
in this in this period i feel like
no matter
all the people that have you know
similar things that i've been through or
have similar lifestyles or have
you know advice to give i feel like my
mom still beats them all
even though she's new to this just as i
am
you know meaning fame and
this kind of world but
my mom has a very good way of looking at
the world and she's the main person that
i i go to and
like literally like the almost the only
person
so
my mom
[Music]
face recognition like there's no home
button what the heck they've made
monograms crazy what the hell is a
monogram a hologram is what i meant it's
crazy that you can charge your phone by
like putting it on that little disc
robots doing stuff
the vaccine dude hell yeah i
really
really urge you if you are not already
vaccinated please get vaccinated it's
not just for you you selfish it's
for everyone around you take care of the
people around you man
protect your friends protect your
children protect your grandparents
protect
anyone you walk by
brockhampton tierra whack is sick my
favorite artist is techno i've been
loving some arlo parks
my favorite artist at the moment is
the doe
who like changed my life and perspective
on music
last year it was like one of their
albums i think they only have two albums
one is called
a mouthful and one is called shake shook
shaken shake shake shaken was my
main
source of inspiration
during the making of happier than ever
the album
last year all summer i would just listen
to it to and from phineas house when we
would make the album and then i'd
drive around and i'd go swimming and i'd
play it and it like changed my life that
album and it still does and a mouthful
has also changed my life as of this week
my brother is my best friend my brother
is my best friend my best friend is
phineas
but he is also my brother we got drew we
got zoe we got laura we got shark
we got my family my brother
those is my best friends
i got a lot of good friends
phineas is
definitely one of my best friends
my mom my dad
blank blank blank blank blank blank
blank
are the other best friends
a tattoo maybe
no face tattoos
the only two tattoos i want to get are
the ones that barely anyone could see
i did get a tattoo
but you won't ever see it light again
i have three tattoos now
i have one here
that says eilish
yes i love myself i have one here big
boy here which is a dragon and then i
just got this a few weeks ago which is
some fairies
that are from a book that i had growing
up
a little fairy book called feriapolis
they're like my little
guardian angel fairies i love tattoos my
mom is her hands on her head look at the
way she's sitting rude mom be supportive
my mom hates tattoos no i'm not gonna be
all tatted up but i you know have some
more ideas right now i feel i feel
pretty satisfied
i feel like in a good zone with them i
felt the urge for a while and now i'm
like ah
give me a little more time and then i'll
get another one but i got the dragon
right after last year's all i had at the
last one was this little guy
soda did this one lucy did this one
dragon did this one
amazing people
first thing that came to mind is like
when it's when my feet are close to the
bottom of the bed
that's the scariest part of my day every
day
i jump from like two feet away from my
bed onto the bed and if my feet
are too close to the bottom uh under my
bed i go
like i can't help myself by gag it's
disgusting it creeps me out oh it creeps
me out so much
that's why i like all the furniture at
my house there's nothing underneath i
they all go to the ground i made that
very very clear when i was getting all
my furniture i was like
please don't get anything with space
underneath so all my chairs my couches
my bed frame it all goes all the way to
the ground there's no storage i don't i
would rather lose the storage space
under my bed
than have to step next to the bottom of
my bed
dead ass
i don't really get scared of like
scary things you know like i had a huge
anaconda literally almost choked me to
death
that was so much fun
so much fun i guess that
what is the scariest thing i've ever
done
fallen in love
what
my relationships
bring me a lot of joy babs bring me a
lot of joy like the things that like
just automatically bring me joy are
rain
and clouds and like
mist and fog like these things aren't
they they just i feel happy i have
seasonal affective disorder but the
opposite where i am i am so happy in
gloomy weather and i am pretty miserable
in hot
sunny blue sky weather i
very seriously i i find myself
pretty depressed in the summertime just
because of the weather
and other things but just that's like
the that's initially the thing
yeah
being on stage makes me feel incredibly
powerful there's a part in my show where
i
get on a
lift
that like takes me over the crowd and i
like lean over the edge and look down
and that is a
kind of power that no one should feel
whoosh it makes me feel literally
invincible it's crazy i don't know
clothing
like
clothing makes you feel powerful and it
can also make you feel very very weak
so that's that's a big thing
little things man
oh do i feel grown up for the most part
yeah i feel like i've
felt very grown up this year and i
really like it i like
growing up a lot
i loved being young and i still am young
but i i loved being a teenager and i
kind of have always dreaded growing up
and getting older and it's always been
really scary to me but i've
enjoyed the hell out of it i love it i
love being able to do things on my own
and
have my own freedom and my own choices
and my own
you know right to things it's very
exciting
my mommy come here this is my mom she is
sick as a booty i don't mind i can stay
here that long
i love it
hello baby his grandma
i love you so much i love you so much
come here
join me
i love you billy

man
i
made an album
i put out an album i did get two more
grammys the documentary came out that
was terrifying went to the bond premiere
in london which was amazing i've never
seen something so crazy i met the royal
family i put out a book i did an amazon
special i put out a movie with disney
which was called a love letter to los
angeles which was amazing
i'm launching a fragrance
which is the most exciting thing to me
no disrespect to all the other things
i've accomplished but
that's very exciting
i was a
host at the met gala
which was
an unbelievable
opportunity
thing i got to do and i wore a big
beautiful dress made by oscar de la
renta
who i
said at the beginning of the
conversation of let's make a miguel
address
you have to stop using fur
because if you don't i'm not working
with you that was also thanks to my mom
for
being with me on that one and and
fighting for it with me so uh
i got oscar de la renta to stop using
fur
completely and that was a really really
big
big thing for me and i i
hope that
more
brands
um follow along with being
environmentally conscious and
try to help the world instead of
make it worse so
yeah
the shows are like the one thing that i
feel like
i've ever been good at i know that
sounds stupid but it's like the only
thing i've ever done that made me feel
like
i belonged
keeping my family safe
and
you know
staying up
cute thing to say
i second that
for sure
i
was really just falling apart not being
able to do shows because
they are the thing that makes me feel
the best that i am
it it feels like the best that i can be
when i'm on stage and getting to do that
again i was like rewound
like i'm a music box that i can be in a
bad mood before a show and then
come off stage and i'm completely
rejuvenated it like winds me up it's
crazy so yeah i agree with that one i've
had some conversations with bieber about
this ariana's been really cool about
stuff even like katy perry told me that
i could reach out to her whenever gaga
has said it to me before it's you know
it's nice to to hear from people that
like have gone through this and know
what it's like
i guess i turned to my mom honestly the
most
in this in this period i feel like
no matter
all the people that have you know
similar things that i've been through or
have similar lifestyles or have
you know advice to give i feel like my
mom still beats them all
even though she's new to this just as i
am
you know meaning fame and
this kind of world but
my mom has a very good way of looking at
the world and she's the main person that
i i go to and
like literally like the almost the only
person
so
my mom
[Music]
face recognition like there's no home
button what the heck they've made
monograms crazy what the hell is a
monogram a hologram is what i meant it's
crazy that you can charge your phone by
like putting it on that little disc
robots doing stuff
the vaccine dude hell yeah i
really
really urge you if you are not already
vaccinated please get vaccinated it's
not just for you you selfish it's
for everyone around you take care of the
people around you man
protect your friends protect your
children protect your grandparents
protect
anyone you walk by
brockhampton tierra whack is sick my
favorite artist is techno i've been
loving some arlo parks
my favorite artist at the moment is
the doe
who like changed my life and perspective
on music
last year it was like one of their
albums i think they only have two albums
one is called
a mouthful and one is called shake shook
shaken shake shake shaken was my
main
source of inspiration
during the making of happier than ever
the album
last year all summer i would just listen
to it to and from phineas house when we
would make the album and then i'd
drive around and i'd go swimming and i'd
play it and it like changed my life that
album and it still does and a mouthful
has also changed my life as of this week
my brother is my best friend my brother
is my best friend my best friend is
phineas
but he is also my brother we got drew we
got zoe we got laura we got shark
we got my family my brother
those is my best friends
i got a lot of good friends
phineas is
definitely one of my best friends
my mom my dad
blank blank blank blank blank blank
blank
are the other best friends
a tattoo maybe
no face tattoos
the only two tattoos i want to get are
the ones that barely anyone could see
i did get a tattoo
but you won't ever see it light again
i have three tattoos now
i have one here
that says eilish
yes i love myself i have one here big
boy here which is a dragon and then i
just got this a few weeks ago which is
some fairies
that are from a book that i had growing
up
a little fairy book called feriapolis
they're like my little
guardian angel fairies i love tattoos my
mom is her hands on her head look at the
way she's sitting rude mom be supportive
my mom hates tattoos no i'm not gonna be
all tatted up but i you know have some
more ideas right now i feel i feel
pretty satisfied
i feel like in a good zone with them i
felt the urge for a while and now i'm
like ah
give me a little more time and then i'll
get another one but i got the dragon
right after last year's all i had at the
last one was this little guy
soda did this one lucy did this one
dragon did this one
amazing people
first thing that came to mind is like
when it's when my feet are close to the
bottom of the bed
that's the scariest part of my day every
day
i jump from like two feet away from my
bed onto the bed and if my feet
are too close to the bottom uh under my
bed i go
like i can't help myself by gag it's
disgusting it creeps me out oh it creeps
me out so much
that's why i like all the furniture at
my house there's nothing underneath i
they all go to the ground i made that
very very clear when i was getting all
my furniture i was like
please don't get anything with space
underneath so all my chairs my couches
my bed frame it all goes all the way to
the ground there's no storage i don't i
would rather lose the storage space
under my bed
than have to step next to the bottom of
my bed
dead ass
i don't really get scared of like
scary things you know like i had a huge
anaconda literally almost choked me to
death
that was so much fun
so much fun i guess that
what is the scariest thing i've ever
done
fallen in love
what
my relationships
bring me a lot of joy babs bring me a
lot of joy like the things that like
just automatically bring me joy are
rain
and clouds and like
mist and fog like these things aren't
they they just i feel happy i have
seasonal affective disorder but the
opposite where i am i am so happy in
gloomy weather and i am pretty miserable
in hot
sunny blue sky weather i
very seriously i i find myself
pretty depressed in the summertime just
because of the weather
and other things but just that's like
the that's initially the thing
yeah
being on stage makes me feel incredibly
powerful there's a part in my show where
i
get on a
lift
that like takes me over the crowd and i
like lean over the edge and look down
and that is a
kind of power that no one should feel
whoosh it makes me feel literally
invincible it's crazy i don't know
clothing
like
clothing makes you feel powerful and it
can also make you feel very very weak
so that's that's a big thing
little things man
oh do i feel grown up for the most part
yeah i feel like i've
felt very grown up this year and i
really like it i like
growing up a lot
i loved being young and i still am young
but i i loved being a teenager and i
kind of have always dreaded growing up
and getting older and it's always been
really scary to me but i've
enjoyed the hell out of it i love it i
love being able to do things on my own
and
have my own freedom and my own choices
and my own
you know right to things it's very
exciting
my mommy come here this is my mom she is
sick as a booty i don't mind i can stay
here that long
i love it
hello baby his grandma
i love you so much i love you so much
come here
join me
i love you billy
my sweet mama

farting
stinking up the yard love you too
love you
honey
you're funny
peace
[Music]
you
my name is billy eilish billy eilish my
name is billy eilish my name is billy
eilish
my name is billy eilish
you're five
let's do this
i think it's october 18 2017. october
18th 2018. october 18th 2019 october 18
2020. the date is october 18
2021. i'm 15. i'm 16. i'm 17. i'm 18.
i'm 19.
i have 257
000. i have
6.3 million
40.7 million
67.5 million i have
94.1 million followers
the most followed person that follows me
is chloe grace moretz katy perry maybe
justin bieber ariana grande
kylie jenner
[Music]
million
it's way too many followers girl
but thanks for following me picture of
me and charlie xcx it's a picture of me
smiling when i
first posted a picture of my blonde hair
23 million 54 701
which is
ridiculous
public what is that
well
i
have not been in
at all um since
march
11th
before covet at all like i don't go in
public anyway just because it's a
complete disaster
gosh that girl
was going through an identity crisis oh
my gosh
you can see it in my eyes i mean really
the low bun
please what's going on my attitude used
to be well i can't go out you know i
can't go here i can't go there and i
used to just like not even be able to
like go to a park or like go
get food or get coffee i just it freaked
me out in the last year i have
been opened up
to it i really feel grateful for that
because being able to feel confident in
stepping outside without
a hat and a hood and glasses and a mask
and a jacket and doing this or whatever
it's so much better and you don't have
to live like that and i i realize that
this year that i don't have to live like
that per week if i
am going to stuff it's like anywhere i
go but
if i'm like being cautious and like not
trying to be
in everybody's faces it's like i can
manage
my way around people without them
noticing which is cool i didn't i didn't
used to be able to do that because my
pride was too huge i was like i only
want to be seen if i look like myself
so i would like never wear anything
normal i would wear like
full on like all of the jewelry that i
owned and my hair is blonde now so it's
not like the only person you've ever
seen with green hair walking by and so
who could it be out of the five people
it's gotten a lot easier but if i go out
i mean it's always gonna happen it's
just that i'm first of all fine with it
and i'm i'm very happy about it and also
i just know how to do it now
judge me please
i don't and then one word no
it's my style
billy eilish parody
is my style
i'm so much more open to stuff now so i
guess i would say like
anything
goes any being one word thing being the
second word and then goes
period i did that vogue cover and it was
a genre that we were doing a shoot for
it was a an old kind of hollywood
lingerie
kind of classic
thing
and it was supposed to be like a
specific aesthetic for a photo shoot and
then it was like billy eilish's new
style and then people kept being like
wow her new style like wow it's so much
better than the old style or like wow i
wish that we could have our old style
back i'm so sad that she's
just changed into this and it was so
weird cause i was like it's not a new
style it's
one thing i wore and then i'm gonna wear
this another day and then i'm gonna do
this and literally the thing that i've
been preaching about since i first
started
is
wear what you want
dress how you want act how you want talk
how you want be how you want
that's all i've ever said it's just
being open to new things and not
you know
letting people
ruin it for you i am
for sure a billion times more confident
confident than both of those years
i feel like i'm probably the most
confident i've ever been in my life
that's true
uh yeah no nothing will ever top that
2019
ego
i was feeling myself that is for sure
it's because i had been so miserable for
so long that i finally wasn't and i just
never shut up about it but i've been
i've been good i've been good i mean i'm
starting to have like an adulthood
which is new for me
and
very exciting and i
have had new experiences and new people
and
lots of love
i don't feel
like i do
yes
yeah
uh yep
yeah
but i don't care i really don't
care like it's like
it's the kind of pressure that sounds
like it's me and then i don't care
like i know
and like it's in my brain that people
expect a lot from me and that they
expect this and they want me to do this
and this is just me trying to convince
myself that i didn't care
every single one
every single one i know that i cared and
i was just literally coming up with some
stupid quote that would make me pretend
that i didn't care 80 000 people is way
easier than performing in front of eight
people that's true i used to be just
filled with these like inspirational
quotes just like ready to go all the
time
that i didn't even agree with most of
the time kind of crazy every time i see
an interview from that period when i was
like 16 i'm like
everything i said was so stupid like not
even stupid it just was like not what i
was actually thinking i was thinking
like i'm overwhelmed i hate this
everybody expects something from me i
don't have anything to give them i
 suck
my jewelry is cool
i want tattoos i want a car that's all i
was thinking like i was not thinking
that stuff
i feel a lot of pressure but i also
would say like
back then
i was more loved
i was pretty i was pretty overall like
loved i would say to be honest
and
so i was like scared because i really
wanted to keep that love
and now like tons of people hate me so
i'm not worried anymore i'm like oh okay
well
if you like me like maybe you don't you
don't so
there are things that i regret but i
don't know if i would
change them because everything that
happened that i regret like made me the
way i am and like everybody says that
and it's pretty cliche but it's pretty
true so
i don't know i feel like every situation
that i've been in where
you know maybe i wasn't being the best
that i could i think i learned from it
see
one of those
just another one of those stupid little
oh i'm really smart
and i really know
of course i had regard to regrets dude
don't be so sad it's such a waste of
time
[Music]
don't
post everything you think
this poor kid
oh my god
don't take
anything for granted don't ever come off
stage during this year and think
i didn't really like that show i didn't
really nope
nope
and by the way i'm never doing that
again when shows are allowed i'm
every show is gonna be the best show
i've ever done oh boy you know what's
funny it's so funny how
fast we get used to things it's kind of
scary because you think you know when
you don't have something you think like
oh my god when i have that in front of
me i'm not even gonna get used to it
it's gonna be so exciting and new and
it's exciting for like two seconds and
then it's not and it's super weird i
don't mean shows i just mean everything
in general it takes one second to get
used to stuff
because that's what we're
we're meant to do is adapt i wish that i
could actually tell that year ago billy
because boy was i
suffering not playing shows and not
seeing fans in real life and
you know being able to actually be with
them for real and not through a screen
so it's been amazing but it's so crazy
how fast i just like picked it all right
back up you know i feel like everything
is permanent all the time and it's not
things go in waves and things happen and
things stop and they start and it's like
you you just have no idea what's to come
ever and i think just try to be aware of
the amazing things you have going on
right in the moment instead of
later because even though then you know
i felt like
a year ago now like nothing was good and
and
i had nothing i like to do and there was
nothing that was
and there was so many things that now i
look back and i'm like ah that was cool
and it's just so weird that we don't
realize what's in front of us at all
until it's not it's very weird
my family i'm i'm always talking to my
family always
every second in my life my mom and dad
still come on tour with me finney still
comes on tour with me every day
pretty much every day we're always
together always talking always you know
whatever it's great i love my family i
am so lucky to have my family right now
both of my parents every day for sure i
mean i guess some days go by when i
don't but pretty much every single day
and like phineas pretty much every day
again some days go by right now but
my family is still just as involved as
they have always been in in all the good
ways
i love my family dearly
from fruitvale station
it'll always be up there but i
recently saw a movie called i origins
which was so
so good
i had no idea what it was and i just
finished showed it to me randomly in the
airport and i just it was amazing
five grammys
one two three four
five
six seven
performed at the oscars met like every
celebrity that's ever existed and it was
the most overwhelming insane surreal
thing i've ever experienced i went to
the brits i won a brit it was amazing i
performed
we recorded the bond theme song and
working with hans zimmer and the
orchestra to record it and completely
surreal and amazing
gosh it's been a crazy couple of years
man
i
made an album
i put out an album i did get two more
grammys the documentary came out that
was terrifying went to the bond premiere
in london which was amazing i've never
