was music midtown in atlanta
40 000 people such a dream oh my god
such a dream every time i go anywhere
hands down i might be safe if i go to
trader joe's
but everywhere else is kind of
get recognized which is actually really
cool but you know it's a lot
kind of a lot actually but like not a
ton it's kind of
like maybe like once a week um
i'm kind of jealous of billy a year ago
because i kind of i don't know i'm
really not about to pity myself
for people recognizing who i am which is
because it's like i'm really grateful
for it
but i don't know i i would like to go
to i don't know anywhere and not be
always recognized whoa
don't be so sad it's such a waste of
time
i didn't i didn't live up to that then
and i still haven't lived up to that
so it's good advice though it is a waste
of time dude
ah it's ruined so many things that could
have been amazing
because i was sad dumb but
whatever
[Music]
don't post everything you think
don't just don't if you're watching this
right now
anybody if anybody is watching this
don't
post your feelings don't
do it to yourself um
whoa tyler the creator
no i would love to meet i've not met him
oh my god i would explode if i met him i
met him
i met him and it was great
for me he hits a he hits a part of me
that nobody gets
being apple's up next artist
[Music]
i was such a baby
i did ellen last week jimmy fallon
lollapalooza
um so many festivals i went to tokyo
i met takashi murakami i went to his
studio
dave girl's daughter did a cover of my
song he played guitar for her at a
talent show
i think or something there's been a lot
of that's happened in the last year
my family i'm i'm always talking to my
family always
[Music]
every second of my life fruitville
station
uh fruitvale station
no uh you know what
no this i can't afford a real chain they
are real now they are real but it's all
silver
oh yeah my chains were gifts i did not
buy anything that i'm wearing
at all none of it
[Music]
i bought this though
[Music]
nah yes
yeah uh yep yeah
it's the kind of pressure that's like it
hits me and then i don't care
everybody drop dead right now and i
didn't
i would be left with what i had created
for myself
and what the hell would the point be if
i was just creating something that
somebody else wanted me to create that i
had no say in
and then that person died and everybody
else died and nobody mattered except me
i'm stuck with this i didn't want
in the first place that's trash
no i'm handling the pressure horribly
but i just keep it to myself
all the time except my wall i write
everything i feel on my wall so if you
go in my room look at my wall
just yeah no
i don't like dating at all i don't like
the idea of
oh this is my one person and i only
share time with this person no no
no no thank you
no i don't have a boyfriend i ca i could
not have a boyfriend that would just be
mean to him
uh i don't know i almost had one for
like a little but
it wasn't really exclusive so i don't
know what you'd call that i hate things
that are exclusive
never letting myself be mistreated
for a long long long long time
i had no idea what the was coming
not really uh yeah i was really
mistreated and then i just realized i
was better than that and since then
i just i feel like i've just grown to
know my worth
i think it's taken a minute and i don't
think i'm there yet but i'm
i'm getting there oh billy was so hurt
then
i was so hurt then man
i want to learn that it's all worth it
because it's tiring as heck
and it is worth it and i have to
remember that because
being with like fans and doing shows is
way more important than being tired
is it worth it
[Music]
yes
[Music]
the shows make it worth it the shows and
the supporters
that is something you have to remember
when it it doesn't feel worth it
because a lot of it doesn't feel worth
it but then you get to the points that
do make it worth it and it's like
then it all sort of makes sense and it
kind of clicks in your head no matter
what you do there's
you can never ever ever please anyone
ever
ever ever
facts still true never not true
any picture that is taken of you
if a picture is taken of you somebody
has it and somebody will use it against
you
i wasn't allowed to but i ran away from
security
and i ran into a huge crowd
i like slammed open a door into all of
them through a glass window and
hugged them all i almost caused a
stampede
by sneaking through a crowd at
lollapalooza
i almost died and everyone else almost
died
crazy whoa lil wayne
oh to perform with lil wayne that's a
great answer
wow 15 year old me was ballin i really
want to go to japan again
i went to japan a while ago and it was
the most amazing time
so i feel like brazil might be crazy
literally my first fan account was like
or like second panic it was like billy
island brazil
brockhampton tierra whack is sick
i like bright green a lot
i like black it's been pretty dark
lately so i've just wanted to be dark
with it
the world i mean
[Music]
i don't and then one word no
[Music]
judge me please
that's what i said
i still feel that way totally still feel
that way
but this year i guess i just don't
 know
i don't know what the is going on
i feel this and that i feel like
everything needs to have a certain this
is in this category and this isn't this
like it's like i want to be everything
like shut up
don't tell me what i can't be the hell
[Music]
the music industry man we're all sad as
hell
all these artists we're sad as dude
everybody i know that's an artist
we are sad
that's the way it is my what
what does that even mean what does that
mean everyone is gonna die and no one is
gonna remember you
so it what this said
that's my philosophy
having the approach that no one's had
trying to write something no one's
written
i don't know if that's the best approach
because you might just fail and then
want to die
like i have to write someone right
something no one's ever heard
see that's why i'm i'm still bad at it
because that's what i was trying to do
 you better know how to drive
because i've been putting off driver's
ed because that stuff stinks i hate that
stuff
i do know how to drive shorty well that
is crazy
this is my mom she is sick as a booty
and she has laryngitis as heck i still
love you
