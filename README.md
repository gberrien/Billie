### Data Collection Process:

The transcripts of the 2018 and 2021 Vanity Fair interviews were retrieved using a simple Python program. The program utilized the YoutubeTranscriptApi which is a python API that allows you to get the transcript/subtitles for a given YouTube video. All that is needed to retrieve a transcript for a specific video is the video ID which can be found in the URL for that video. Once the transcripts were retrieved, they were written to text files. 

See the Python program used to retrieve the transcripts here: https://github.com/gberrien/Billie/blob/main/SRC/FetchTranscript.py
